Want to contribute to OBS but don't know how to program? Help us with our translations!

To help us manage our translations, we use a service called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), which is free to use for open source projects. You can check out the OBS Studio translation project [here](https://crowdin.com/project/obs-studio).

**How do I contribute?**

* Register an account on Crowdin.
* Find the language you want to help contribute to.
* Open one of the strings files and look at the strings that can be translated or have already been translated.
* If you see something that has not been translated yet, suggest a translation!
* If you see something that has been translated well, vote it up!
* If you see something that has been translated poorly, vote it down and make a new suggestion!

**Tips**

* If you need more context about how a string is used, open a new issue in the translation editor and request additional contextualization.
* If you're editing Website strings, keep an eye on the context to make sure translating them doesn't change the functionality.
* Crowdin's Knowledge Base provides information on getting started as a translator. See [Work in the Editor](https://support.crowdin.com/for-volunteer-translators/#work-in-the-editor).
* For any issues or questions you can directly contact [Vainock](https://crowdin.com/messages/create/15326052/51028) who is happy to assist.
