## GPU selection for NVIDIA based laptops

* This guide will show you how to select the graphics card OBS is running on using the native control panel from NVIDIA.
* It is valid if you are running Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10 up to version 1903.
* If you run Windows 10 1903 or newer, use [this guide](Laptop-GPU-Selection-Windows-10) instead.

## Setup

* Close OBS if it is currently open
* Go to the NVIDIA Control Panel by right clicking on your desktop, and then clicking on "NVIDIA Control Panel"
