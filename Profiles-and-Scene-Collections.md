**First things first:** _Profiles do not include the scenes and sources!_

To quote from a OBS forum:
Profiles contain more than just your stream key. They contain all recroding and streaming encoder settings, your canvas and output size, several advanced options, and various other settings in the Settings menu.

Scene Collections contain your scenes, sources, and audio settings. They are separate for very good reasons. Many users stream to multiple services, and it's very useful to simply switch those profile settings rather than having to change entire scene collections. Saving both to the same place is a waste of resources, and this is unlikely to be changed.
