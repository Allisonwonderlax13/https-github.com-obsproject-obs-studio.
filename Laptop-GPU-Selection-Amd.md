## GPU selection for AMD based laptops

* This guide will show you how to select the graphics card OBS is running on using the native control panel from AMD.
* It is valid if you are running Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10 prior to version 1903.
* If you run Windows 10 1903 or newer, use [this guide](Laptop-GPU-Selection-Windows-10) instead.

***

## Setup

* Close OBS if it is currently open


If you are using an AMD-based laptop, check the [Official AMD support documentation](http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/DH-017.aspx).
