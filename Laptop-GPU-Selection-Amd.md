## GPU selection for AMD based laptops

* This guide will show you how to select the graphics card OBS is running on using the native control panel from AMD.
* It is valid if you are running Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 10 prior to version 1903.
* If you run Windows 10 1903 or newer, use [this guide](Laptop-GPU-Selection-Windows-10) instead.

### We recommend to run Windows 10 1903 or newer on AMD switchable GPU laptops. The [Windows 10 method](Laptop-GPU-Selection-Windows-10) is more reliable and easier to setup then using the AMD control panel.

## Setup

* Close OBS if it is currently open

Follow the [Official AMD support documentation](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/dh-017) on how to add OBS to run on a specific GPU.

* The default paths for the executable of OBS are:
  - 64-bit OBS (default): `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe`
  - 32-bit OBS: `C:\Program Files (x86)\obs-studio\bin\32bit\obs32.exe`

## For Display Capture

* Choose "Power Saving" option

## For Window Capture and Game Capture

* Choose "High Performance" option
