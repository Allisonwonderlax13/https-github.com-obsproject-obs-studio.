Hi my stream just started to lag the last time i streamed with no changes. It was working great for a while streaming ofeten 3-6hrs at a time with no problems but not when i try to stream in obs it says encoder overload when i try to stream. i did not change any settings. I am not sure what the problem is. this is my last log.
