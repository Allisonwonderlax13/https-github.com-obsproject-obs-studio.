# Linux

## Prerequisites for all versions

* xserver-xorg version 1.18.4 or newer is recommended to avoid potential performance issues with certain features in OBS, such as the fullscreen projector.
* OpenGL 3.3 (or later) support is required to use OBS Studio on Linux. You can check what version of OpenGL is supported by your system by typing `glxinfo | grep "OpenGL"` on Terminal.
* For virtual camera support, you need the v4l2loopback-dkms module installed. You can install it with the following command: 
  * Debian/Ubuntu-based: 
    ```bash
    sudo apt install v4l2loopback-dkms
    ```
  * Red Hat/Fedora-based:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install kmod-v4l2loopback
    ```
  * Arch Linux-based/Manjaro:
    
    You will need to install the kernel headers package of your actual kernel beforehand or the module will not be completely installed.
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -Sy v4l2loopback-dkms
    ```
